                            <b>Our goal:</b> Lower package theft in neighborhoods; <b>1.7 million</b> packages go missing daily
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            
Our team has developed an innovative solution to address the growing need for secure and convenient package delivery. We have designed a sleek and durable crate that can be easily placed on the porches of homeowners or in front of businesses. The crate is engineered to remain naturally locked in a static state, ensuring that packages remain safe and secure until retrieved.
<br>
<br>
To further enhance the security of the crate, we have incorporated an advanced RFID system that is connected to a high-quality solenoid lock. Delivery drivers will be granted access to the crate through their scanner, while homeowners can provide the unique RFID code associated with their crate in their delivery instructions. With this system in place, all packages can be conveniently and securely delivered to the crate and remain protected until retrieved by the homeowner or intended recipient.
<br>
<br>
Our crate is designed to provide a simple and effective solution to the growing problem of package theft and loss. With its sleek and durable design, advanced RFID system, and high-quality lock, our crate offers a reliable and secure way to receive and store packages. Whether for personal or business use, our crate is sure to provide a hassle-free and secure delivery experience for all.

                                To create our circuit, we initially designed an RFID circuit activating an LED upon successful scan. We then integrated a solenoid lock for independent function. Choosing a power source posed challenges—originally a nine-volt battery fell short on amps for the solenoid. Considering a twelve-volt battery, we faced design constraints. The RFID circuit's power consumption led us to a 12V-2A AC-DC wall plug, addressing power needs for the solenoid and eliminating frequent battery changes.





                                <br>
<br>
After completing crate construction, tests were conducted for robustness and user-friendliness. Time constraints limited data collection for homeowner market validation. To address this, surveys will gauge homeowner interest. Recognizing the need for durability, future iterations will explore heavier materials like metal. Acknowledging manufacturing errors, despite quality assurance, we recognize the box's structural integrity might be affected. Our product acts as a proof of concept, showcasing RFID technology's potential to enhance security in the delivery industry.





<br>
<br>
Notably, weatherproofing is an area requiring improvement in the box. Prioritizing size and shape over material choice, we opted for wood, which may warp in moisture, risking structural integrity and door malfunction. To address this, we plan to test the box's temperature stability by placing a thermometer inside and exposing it to varying temperatures.





<br>
<br>
In summary, the construction process encompassed designing an RFID circuit, integrating a solenoid lock, choosing a power source, and conducting tests for robustness and user-friendliness. Acknowledging room for improvement, particularly in weatherproofing and durability, we are dedicated to exploring innovative solutions to enhance the overall quality of the box.

                                Team roles focused on maximizing learning. Despite my usual electronics role, I led crate construction, emphasizing insulation and sleek wood siding. We split into two groups for simultaneous work, with me coordinating and documenting design changes. Other team members focused on circuitry, solenoid-RFID integration, and coding crate unlocking. Collaboration ensured successful product implementation.

                                Our project works as proof of concept for a secure delivery solution that can help protect packages from theft during the drop-off and retrieval process. While we had some budgetary limitations during the construction phase, our team was able to successfully design and build a functioning security box that demonstrates the effectiveness of RFID technology in preventing package theft.

                                <br>
                                As we continue to refine and improve our design, we recognize the importance of constructing the box with more durable materials, including a sturdy metal construction, to ensure that it can withstand harsh weather conditions and potential break-in attempts. We also believe that our solution has the potential to be integrated into the services of delivery companies, providing an additional layer of security for their customers.

                                To cater to the diverse needs of homeowners and businesses, we plan to offer a range of sizes and aesthetics for the security box, so that it can be customized to fit each individual's unique requirements. Overall, we are confident that our project has the potential to make a significant impact in the package delivery industry and provide a much-needed solution to the ongoing problem of package theft.
