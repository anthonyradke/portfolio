                            <b>Our goal:</b> Lower package theft in neighborhoods; <b>1.7 million</b> packages go missing daily
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            
Our team has developed an innovative solution to address the growing need for secure and convenient package delivery. We have designed a sleek and durable crate that can be easily placed on the porches of homeowners or in front of businesses. The crate is engineered to remain naturally locked in a static state, ensuring that packages remain safe and secure until retrieved.
<br>
<br>
To further enhance the security of the crate, we have incorporated an advanced RFID system that is connected to a high-quality solenoid lock. Delivery drivers will be granted access to the crate through their scanner, while homeowners can provide the unique RFID code associated with their crate in their delivery instructions. With this system in place, all packages can be conveniently and securely delivered to the crate and remain protected until retrieved by the homeowner or intended recipient.
<br>
<br>
Our crate is designed to provide a simple and effective solution to the growing problem of package theft and loss. With its sleek and durable design, advanced RFID system, and high-quality lock, our crate offers a reliable and secure way to receive and store packages. Whether for personal or business use, our crate is sure to provide a hassle-free and secure delivery experience for all.

                                - <b>12V Solenoid Lock:</b> The solenoid lock was selected for its exceptional energy efficiency. In its static state, the lock requires no power to remain secured. This offers an added layer of protection against theft or unauthorized access to the crate and its contents, even when the crate is unplugged.                                <br>
                                <br>
                                - <b>RFID System:</b> Our product's functionality heavily relies on the RFID system. It enables delivery drivers to gain access to the crate and deliver packages seamlessly. The system's uniqueness lies in the fact that each RFID key is exclusive, giving delivery drivers the ability to reprogram their scanners to the unique key provided by homeowners in the delivery instructions. In contrast to traditional mechanical keys, the use of RFID technology provides a swift and effortless system for homeowners.                                <br>
                                <br>
                                - <b>Insulation & Padding:</b> Ensuring the protection of temperature-sensitive packages was a top priority in the development of our product. To achieve this, we chose to insulate the entire crate, offering an additional layer of security against extreme temperatures, particularly for packages containing perishable food or medicine. Moreover, the foam padding located at the bottom of the crate functions as a safeguard for fragile packages. This feature is especially important since delivery drivers may not always handle packages with the utmost care.                                <br>
                                <br>
                                - <b>Aesthetics:</b> Our crate's wooden siding exudes a polished and refined appearance, seamlessly integrating the product into homeowners' front porch aesthetics. This design choice provides a sense of cohesiveness and avoids any semblance of a mismatch. In the future, we intend to provide an array of design options for customers to choose from, giving them the ability to customize the crate to their liking.                                <br>
                                <br>
                                - <b>Power:</b> The decision to transition from a battery to a wall outlet marked a significant turning point in our project's development. Our team conducted thorough longevity testing on the battery, which informed our decision to switch to a wall outlet. The use of a wall outlet eliminates the frequent need to replace batteries, making the system safer and more reliable. (see more in testing / analysis section)                                <br>

                                To create our circuit, we first had to design and construct an RFID circuit that activates an LED upon a successful scan. Once this was achieved, we incorporated a solenoid lock into the circuit, enabling the power-hungry solenoid to function independently from the breadboard and RFID scanner setup. Next, we had to determine a suitable power source. Initially, we intended to utilize a standard nine-volt battery. However, when we connected the circuit to an adjustable power supply, we discovered that the battery did not supply sufficient amps to hold the solenoid open. We explored the possibility of using a twelve-volt battery but found it challenging to incorporate it into our box design. Additionally, we realized that the RFID circuit consumed a lot of power as it continually checks for RFID tags in the vicinity. Therefore, to resolve the power constraints, we opted for a 12Volt-2Amp AC-DC wall plug, which provides ample power for the solenoid and eliminates the need to change batteries frequently.
<br>
<br>
Once the construction of the crate was completed, we performed several tests to evaluate its robustness and user-friendliness. However, due to time constraints, we could not collect sufficient data to validate the suitability of our product for the homeowner market. To address this, we intend to conduct surveys to determine the homeowner's interest in our product. We also realized that future iterations of the box should incorporate heavier and more durable materials like metal to improve the box's strength and longevity. Furthermore, we acknowledge that manufacturing errors could affect the box's structural integrity, despite our best efforts to ensure its quality. Our product serves as a proof of concept of how RFID technology can be incorporated into the delivery industry to improve security. 
<br>
<br>
Notably, an aspect that requires improvement is the weatherproofing of the box. Our decision to prioritize size and shape over material led us to construct the box out of wood, which may warp when exposed to moisture, thus jeopardizing the box's structural integrity and causing the door to malfunction. To address this, we intend to test the box's ability to maintain a steady temperature by placing a thermometer inside it and exposing it to varying temperatures.
<br>
<br>
In summary, the construction process involved designing an RFID circuit, integrating a solenoid lock, determining a power source, and conducting tests to evaluate its robustness and user-friendliness. We recognize that improvements can be made to address weatherproofing and durability concerns, and we remain committed to exploring innovative solutions to enhance the overall quality of the box.

                                    Our team's approach to assigning roles and responsibilities was centered on maximizing each member's potential for learning and growth. As such, we took on tasks and responsibilities that we were not necessarily proficient or comfortable with. In my case, I focused primarily on the physical construction of the crate. This involved spending considerable time in the woodworking shop, measuring and cutting materials, and assembling the box. I was particularly involved in insulating the interior of the crate and installing the wood siding on the exterior, which gave the product a professional and sleek look. Although my usual role on the team would have been working on electronics and circuitry, I took on this new responsibility to broaden my skill set.

                         <p>
                            To maximize our team's productivity, we divided into two groups of three and worked on separate parts of the project simultaneously. I played a crucial role in coordinating between these two smaller teams, ensuring that all significant design changes were documented, and knowledge was passed along. By doing so, I helped ensure that our team's individual contributions were aligned and that we avoided organizational problems.
                         </p>

                            The other team members were responsible for the circuitry and ensuring that the solenoid would function properly with the RFID system. This involved a lot of trial and error, and they received assistance from the electronics department. They also worked on coding the system to determine how long the crate would remain unlocked once the RFID key was detected. Their contributions were integral to the successful implementation of our product.
